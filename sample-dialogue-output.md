### Phase 2: Critical UX Evaluation

**👩‍⚕️ Dr. Sarah Kim** (2024-01-15 14:32:45) - **Feedback** (Priority: URGENT)

> **UX Evaluation Results - Current Satisfaction: 60/100**
> 
> I've conducted a thorough evaluation of the current website. While there's a solid foundation, several critical issues need immediate attention before this can provide an acceptable user experience.
> 
> **CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:**
> 
> **1. Korean UX (HIGH PRIORITY)**
> - **Problem**: Typography and spacing not optimized for Korean text readability
> - **User Impact**: Korean users may struggle with text comprehension and scanning
> - **Requirement**: Implement proper Korean typography with optimal line-height and character spacing
> 
> **2. Navigation (HIGH PRIORITY)**
> - **Problem**: Navigation structure may not follow Korean web conventions
> - **User Impact**: Users expect familiar patterns - current structure may cause confusion
> - **Requirement**: Research and implement Korean web navigation patterns
> 
> **3. Accessibility (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
> - **Problem**: Missing semantic HTML and ARIA labels throughout the application
> - **User Impact**: Users with disabilities cannot effectively use the website
> - **Requirement**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader testing
> 
> **4. Mobile Experience (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
> - **Problem**: Mobile interactions and touch targets need optimization
> - **User Impact**: Mobile users (majority in Korea) may have poor experience
> - **Requirement**: Mobile-first approach with Korean mobile UX patterns
> 
> **5. Visual Hierarchy (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
> - **Problem**: Information hierarchy is not clear enough for quick scanning
> - **User Impact**: Users cannot quickly find what they need
> - **Requirement**: Stronger visual hierarchy with clear content prioritization
> 
> **What I DO appreciate:**
> • Modern React architecture provides good foundation
> • Internationalization setup is promising
> • Clean gradient design has potential
> 
> **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
> 1. Korean typography optimization
> 2. Navigation UX improvement
> 3. Accessibility compliance
> 4. Mobile experience enhancement
> 
> As a user experience professional, I cannot recommend this website in its current state. The Korean user experience is particularly concerning - Korean users have specific expectations and interaction patterns that are not being met.
> 
> **My questions for you:**
> 1. How will you address the Korean typography and readability issues?
> 2. What's your plan for implementing proper Korean web navigation conventions?
> 3. How will you ensure accessibility compliance, especially for Korean screen readers?
> 4. What specific mobile optimizations will you implement for Korean users?
> 
> I need to see concrete, actionable solutions with implementation timelines. The current state is not acceptable for launch.
