3. **Iterative Improvement** - Structured cycles of proposals and evaluations
4. **Agreement Protocol** - Clear criteria for approval and implementation readiness
5. **Implementation Roadmap** - Prioritized action plan with timelines and responsibilities

### Intelligent Context Management
- **Reference System** - Links to specific code files, design elements, and user requirements
- **Satisfaction Tracking** - Quantitative measurement of approval levels (0-100 scale)
- **Conversation History** - Maintains context across multiple exchange cycles
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of communication failures and misunderstandings

### Quality Assurance Features
- **Evidence-Based Evaluation** - All feedback supported by specific criteria and metrics
- **Cultural Sensitivity** - Korean localization expertise and cultural design considerations
- **Accessibility Focus** - WCAG compliance and inclusive design requirements
- **Performance Standards** - Loading speed, mobile optimization, and user experience metrics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import DialogueManager from './src/agents/DialogueManager.js';

const dialogueManager = new DialogueManager();
const conversationId = dialogueManager.startDesignReviewDialogue('Website UX Improvement');
```

### Running Complete Demo
```bash
node dialogue-demo.js
```

### Manual Component Testing
```bash
node dialogue-demo.js --manual
```

## Dialogue Flow Example

```
1. Web Designer → Initial Design Assessment
   - Current strengths and weaknesses analysis
   - Technical improvement opportunities
   - Implementation feasibility assessment

2. Dr. Sarah Kim → Critical UX Evaluation  
   - User experience issues identification
   - Korean localization requirements
   - Accessibility compliance gaps
   - Satisfaction level: 60/100

3. Web Designer → Specific Improvement Proposals
   - Korean typography optimization (Priority: High)
   - Navigation UX enhancement (Priority: High) 
   - Accessibility compliance (Priority: Medium)
   - Mobile experience improvement (Priority: Medium)

4. Dr. Sarah Kim → Proposal Evaluation
   - Detailed scoring of each proposal
   - Requirements for modifications
   - Approval for high-quality proposals
   - Updated satisfaction level: 75/100

5. Iterative Refinement (continues until satisfaction ≥ 80/100)

6. Final Implementation Roadmap
   - Prioritized task list
   - Timeline estimates
   - Responsibility assignments
   - Success metrics
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Adding New Agent Types
```javascript
communicationSystem.registerAgent('security-specialist', {
  name: 'Security Specialist Agent',
  role: 'Security Auditor',
  expertise: ['Vulnerability Assessment', 'Security Compliance', 'Threat Modeling'],
  communicationStyle: 'Risk-focused and compliance-oriented'
});
```

### Customizing Evaluation Criteria
```javascript
// In DrSarahKimAgent.js
this.evaluationCriteria = {
  userExperience: ['intuitive navigation', 'clear information hierarchy'],
  koreanLocalization: ['proper typography', 'cultural appropriateness'],
  accessibility: ['WCAG compliance', 'keyboard navigation'],
  performance: ['fast loading', 'smooth interactions'],
  customCriteria: ['industry-specific requirements']
};
```

### Extending Message Types
```javascript
// In AgentCommunication.js
const messageTypes = [
  'proposal', 'feedback', 'approval', 'rejection', 
  'question', 'conditional_approval', 'clarification', 'implementation_update'
];
```

## Integration Opportunities

### With Development Tools
- **Code Modification**: Direct integration with file editing systems
- **Testing Automation**: Automatic validation of implemented changes
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integration with deployment and testing workflows

### With User Research
- **Real User Feedback**: Connect to actual user testing systems
- **Analytics Integration**: Use real user behavior data in evaluations
- **A/B Testing**: Propose and evaluate alternative design approaches

### With Project Management
- **Task Tracking**: Integration with Jira, GitHub Issues, or other systems
- **Time Estimation**: Connect to actual development velocity metrics
- **Progress Reporting**: Automated status updates to stakeholders

## Performance and Scalability

- **Conversation Persistence**: Save and restore dialogue state across sessions
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Scale to include additional specialist agents
- **Parallel Dialogues**: Handle multiple simultaneous design review conversations
- **Learning Integration**: Improve dialogue patterns based on successful outcomes

## Best Practices

### Effective Agent Communication
1. **Be Specific**: Reference exact code files, line numbers, and design elements
2. **Provide Context**: Include user impact and business justification
3. **Set Clear Criteria**: Define measurable success metrics
4. **Maintain Focus**: Stay on topic and avoid scope creep
5. **Document Decisions**: Preserve reasoning for future reference

### Quality Dialogue Management
1. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Balance quality standards with implementation constraints
2. **Encourage Iteration**: Allow multiple rounds of refinement
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor satisfaction levels and agreement indicators
4. **Handle Conflicts**: Provide clear resolution protocols
5. **Plan Implementation**: Generate actionable roadmaps with timelines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Infinite Loops**: Implement maximum iteration limits and escalation protocols
- **Communication Failures**: Add retry logic and error recovery mechanisms
- **Context Loss**: Enhance conversation history and reference preservation
- **Quality Deadlocks**: Provide compromise protocols and manual override options

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
DEBUG=true node dialogue-demo.js
```
